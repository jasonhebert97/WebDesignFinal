	<h1>ABOUT</h1>
	<div id="about-wrapper">
		<p>I am a fourth-year student at Brown University studying Modern Culture and Media with an emphasis on the technical and sociocultural influences and developments of modern computational technologies. You can use 'he', 'him', and 'his' pronouns
			to
			refer to me. I am racially diverse (Filipino, Abenaki Native American, French, and English) and a first-generation college student.</p>

		<p>Particularly, I hope to understand modern media technologies through a humanitarian and sociocultural lens, while nonetheless developing the skills needed to effectively create within the field of computer-mediated production. Coming from a
			diverse background, diversity, equity, and positionality are crucial to my identity, so I work to
			complicate the White, cisheteronormative, and masculine-dominated computer science field by understanding computation through racialized, gendered, and queer perspectives. Going beyond this, I aim to complicate other idyllic notions of computer
			technologies by contextualizing them within their environmental and classist contexts.</p>
