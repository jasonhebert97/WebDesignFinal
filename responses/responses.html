		<h2><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/" target="_blank">> <span>What is Code?</span></a></h2>
		<h2><a href="https://frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/" target="_blank">> <span>What Screens Want</span></a></h2>
		<p>To put it bluntly, I am not impressed by Frank Chimero’s article: it exposed his own unfamiliarity with media theory. His ideas are not ingenious nor enlightening. He paraphrases the ideals of Ted Nelson which purports a filtered ideal borrowed
			from Marshall McLuhan’s work. Chimero’s notion of remapping is better articulated using the concept of détournement where communities appropriate the suppressive tools used by the power structures to overturn said power structures.</p>
		<p>Chimero uses Nelson to criticize new media — explicitly computers — and offers the creation of differing maps as the solution; however, this supposition is unaware of the necessity of consistency as changing the inner workings of a technology
			makes it evermore inaccessible to new (and even old) users. Making new maps won’t solve the problem: utilizing the current maps may. Chimero tries to bash only new media, but this completely overlooks the similar workings of all preceding media
			forms. McLuhan was aware of this though. McLuhan describes the “medium as the message” which generally means that media are not only the information they carry, but also their affect on mass behavior, perception, and meaning making. Television,
			film, radio, books, and even languages themselves have been used for enforcing certain ideologies onto the masses. Therefore, all media forms alter the way users think, act, and feel. New media are not at all different, but they may have more
			room for marginalized communities to create space. Older media forms were extremely inaccessible to marginalized communities for the longest of times (read: the lack of POC directors in the film and television industry), but new media has already
			shown its ability to aid these marginalized communities in expressing themselves. Some important examples include social media use during the Arab Spring, online information dissemination during the Million Woman March, and the spread of hashtags
			like #BLM (Black Lives Matter) and #MeToo. Even inspecting older media forms shows how the Civil Rights Movement utilized television to its advantage.</p>
		<p>Frank Chimero does have a good point: the current mappings are corrupt and condescending, but his attempt to invalidate these maps completely overlooks the way communities can, have, and will continue to use these mappings to create space for
			expression and education. The examples listed above show some cases of détournement where the current tools, with emphasis on ‘current’, are used to disrupt the regular operations of power structures. Chimero describes a quixotic and selfish view
			of remapping — one that is ignorant of the suppressive structures of power. He publishes this piece with an implicit sense of self-confidence in his ingenuity when POC and other marginalized communities have always been aware of these concepts.
			They just never had as much space to express it.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/" target="_blank">> <span>Vernacular Web 1</span></a></h2>
		<h2><a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/74/59810/jodi-s-infrastructure/" target="_blank">> <span>Jodi's Infrastructure</span></a></h2>
		<p>Olia Lialina’s “The Vernacular Web” is definitely an interesting take at uncovering some of the conventions that disappeared as the culture surrounding the Internet progressed. Although outdated, the piece invokes the semblance of ideas in
			defense of “The Poor Image.” Instead of developing for the professional world, the early web was built on individual expression, flashy (and sometimes trashy) details, and low-bandwidth speeds. Poor images were widespread throughout the early
			web, but they have been stripped away to make room for more modern and simplistic takes. It is definitely valid to critique the ways in which this progression has elapsed: what was once a place of creativity and expression quickly became a medium
			for simplicity and accessibility — which is, of course, both good and bad.</p>
		<p>Alexander Galloway, as pompous and pretentious as most Brown MCM graduates, writes on the modality of the internet, which can be interpreted as augmenting Lialina’s argument. The early web utilized the internet as a medium itself, capable of
			being manipulated and weaponized. More recent trends operate on the belief that the internet serves mainly as a platform for presenting media, rather than being a medium itself. Both ways are useful when considered in the right contexts.</p>
		<p>The two pieces come together nicely, despite there being some erasure of accessibility when utilizing the internet. The flashy elements of the early internet may have been nice, but their replacement may have likely been to reasons of
			increasing accessibility: people using screen readers will have a hard time navigating a webpage full of gifs, starry backgrounds, and flashy URL tricks.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/04/google-facebook-informational-capitalism/" target="_blank">> <span>Capitalism & Privacy</span></a></h2>
		<h2><a href="http://internet-atlas.net/" target="_blank">> <span>Critical Atlas of Internet</span></a></h2>
		<p>Considering the two articles together, it becomes obvious the importance of the Internet’s centralization in America; however, there also becomes an inherent distinction in what is legally allowed for collection by other governing bodies. Per
			“Capitalism vs. Privacy”, informational capitalism, and its pseudonyms, converts privacy into an inherent antagonist to economic profit. By collecting metadata about individuals, digital monopolies are able to target each user by their
			preferences and demographic information. This means faster and more personalized usage, but threatens privacy in archiving an online sense of self. This information collection thus becomes a powerful way for surveillance, and concurrently,
			control. This control, though, is primarily directed at those who opt into the system. Individuals are greeted with privacy policies for each device and application they use. It is not the technologies inherent fault that the users do not take
			the time to educate themselves on what they are getting themselves into.</p>
		<p>What the “Internet Atlas” article resolves about the previous reading is how there are distinct barriers within different countries. Because the Internet was founded and monitored within the United States does not mean all internet
			conglomerates have control everywhere. This article describes “internet balkanization” where the web is divided by invisible borders that encloses users within sub-networks. This is both good and bad of course: this can be used to protect users
			from internet monopolies but at the cost of freedom to explore hidden features. One way to interpret this though, is that each country has the ability to opt out of certain pinpoints of the Internet. Through VPNs and other rerouting softwares,
			users could make this decision themselves.</p>
		<p>An aside to remember when reading all of this though, is how the Internet is still only accessible by the relatively wealthy. Many countries across the globe have limited to no access to the Internet: they are not as affected by this
			technology. Of course, globalization is a problem, but by generalizing that every individual on the globe is impacted similarly by the Internet assumes a coalescence with Western culture, identity, and technology. Both articles imply strongly
			that the Internet is founded on this form of subjugation, which may or may not be entirely true. Experience on the Internet is not a binary: just because there is a general trend in the West does not make it the default across the globe.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/internet-under-fire-gets-new-manifesto/" target="_blank">> <span>Internet Under Fire Gets New Manifesto</span></a></h2>
		<p>The Internet is complex and quickly has complicated things like privacy, ownership, metadata mining, cyber-harassment, anonymity, and personalization: we been knew. Searls and Weinberger may feel proud for contributing a rather common-sensical
			set of standards that those on the Internet should live by, but they have completely ignored the situatedness of the Internet in a grander sociopolitical context.</p>
		<p>Just because there is the potential to make whatever we want does not mean there exists the socio-economic infrastructure to realize it. The Internet may be “specifically designed for everything,” but it was also designed for the wealthy west
			in response to militaristic paranoia.</p>
		<p>It would be great to develop a new manifesto for improving the current situation of the Internet, but the de jure will always differ from the de facto. I stand firmly behind their own sentiment: “If you’ve been talking for a while, shut up.”
			Manifestos are great in theory, but let’s see how well they work in practice when thrown into a world contaminated with privilege, power systems, and corruption. The make talk the talk, but will they walk the walk.</p>
